"""coverage — feature-coverage completeness check and its state (#138 / ADR 0005).

Part of the :mod:`draftwright.linting` package (ADR 0007):

- `lint_feature_coverage` — the completeness check that reports part diameters
  with no callout (#80), avoiding double-reporting a hole a grouped ``n× ⌀``
  callout covers (#92) and suppressing the redundant ``feature_not_dimensioned``
  for capped diameters.
- `CoverageState` — the coverage signal the passes record and the checks read
  (pattern callouts, patterned holes, dropped callout diameters). `Drawing`
  delegates to it and keeps `_pattern_callouts` / `_patterned_holes` /
  `_dropped_callout_diams` reachable as properties during the migration (§4).

(`_suggest_fix` now lives in :mod:`.suggest`; `lint_drawing` in
:mod:`.structural`.) Depends only on `_core` + recognition + the rendering
``TitleBlock``; never on `make_drawing`/`annotate`.

    """Coarse completeness check: report part diameters with no callout (#80).

    ``exclude`` is an optional iterable of diameters already accounted for by a
    more specific build-time lint (e.g. the per-view callout cap's
    ``callout_dropped``); these are skipped here so a dropped callout is not
    double-reported as ``feature_not_dimensioned``.

    ``assembly`` controls severity for a general-arrangement drawing of a
    multi-body part. A GA deliberately omits each part's bores (they belong on
    detail sheets), so demanding a callout for every cylinder is noise. When
    ``assembly`` is ``True`` the coverage codes (``feature_not_dimensioned`` /
    ``feature_count_mismatch``) are emitted at ``info`` severity instead of
    ``warning`` — kept queryable but out of the warning count and quality score.
    ``None`` (the default) auto-detects: a multi-solid ``part`` is treated as an
    assembly. Pass ``False`` to force strict single-part severity (#69).

    Builds a feature inventory from *part*'s hole/boss diameters (cylinder
    patches spanning at least ~half a turn around their axis in total, so
    fillets are ignored) and diffs it against every ø value mentioned in the
    annotations' labels, plus the structured ``covers_diameters`` metadata on
    annotations that draw their values geometrically (e.g. ``HoleCallout``).
    Radius callouts are *not* counted — "R5 TYP" fillet notes would otherwise
    mask an undimensioned ø10 bore. Title blocks are skipped — part numbers
    like "BRACKET R8" are not callouts. Each uncovered diameter yields one
    ``feature_not_dimensioned`` warning.

    ``cyls`` accepts a precomputed ``analyse_cylinders(part)`` result so
    repeated lint runs need not re-scan the solid.

    Counts are checked too (#92): the part's holes (via ``find_holes``) give
    a required count per diameter (each bore, counterbore, and spotface
    occurrence counts one), and structured callouts declare how many holes
    they dimension (``covers_count`` — the ``n×`` prefix). A shortfall
    yields a ``feature_count_mismatch`` warning. A diameter covered by any
    free-text ø-label is exempt from the count check — text labels carry no
    count semantics. Location coverage remains out of scope (#93).
