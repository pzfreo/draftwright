"""Ratchet: tests may read only a DOCUMENTED, shrinking set of ``Drawing`` private attributes.

The #720/#721 family closed test reach-through into the *aliased* privates (the seven with a
public read equivalent, 361 sites) and #722 froze the **src**-side ``dwg._*`` reads to zero. The
last unpoliced quadrant (#741) is test-side **attribute reads** of ``Drawing`` internals that have
no public read yet — ``_analysis``/``_intents``/… They coupled the tests to build-state internals
with no ratchet, so they could silently multiply.

This pins today's read-sites as a per-name ceiling that may only **SHRINK**: thread a read through a
public surface (``_registry`` → :pyattr:`Drawing.registry`), lower its count; at zero, delete the
entry. A NEW private name, or a GROWN count on an existing one, fails here. The remaining entries are
NOT all latent public surface: the #741 triage found most are *intentional white-box* (the #647
transaction/rollback tests, and unit tests of internal render/layout helpers that take the raw
``Analysis``) — pinned with the rationale in :data:`_ALLOW`, exactly as ``test_private_test_imports``
keeps its legitimate helper tests. The ceiling stops the surface *growing*; it does not oblige
exposing engine internals (adding an accessor for an internal value no caller wants would just
rename the coupling — the anti-pattern #741 explicitly warns against).

Scope is **reads** (``Load``-context attribute access, ``getattr(_, "_name")`` probes, and
``AugAssign`` targets). Private *writes* (chiefly ``dwg._defer_intents = …``) are NOT counted here:
they are the transaction-test cluster above and legitimately drive the flag directly (``deferred()``
auto-finalizes, so it can't express "fail mid-drain, inspect state"), so there is nothing to migrate.

Keyed on the attribute *name* (∈ :data:`_DRAWING_PRIVATES`), not the receiver — test receivers
vary (``dwg``/``d``/``direct``/``scripted``/…), unlike the src guard's ``dwg``/``drawing``. A stray
same-named private on a non-Drawing object would be pinned too (harmless, fail-closed). Mirrors
``test_private_test_imports`` / ``test_drawing_encapsulation``; stdlib ``ast`` + ``pathlib`` only
(:func:`test_drawing_privates_set_is_current` alone imports ``Drawing``, to keep the name-set honest).

**A ratchet, not a sandbox** (the sibling guards' stance). Two limits are accepted by design:

- *Static reflection is unresolvable.* ``getattr(dwg, name)`` with a non-literal ``name``,
  ``dwg.__dict__["_analysis"]``, ``vars(dwg)[…]``, ``object.__getattribute__`` — the scanner sees
  only the *common, honest* forms (attribute access, ``getattr`` with a constant, ``+=`` targets).
  Reflective escapes can't be caught statically; they are rare and would surface in review.
- *This is a CARDINALITY ratchet.* The guarantee is that the **net per-name read count never
  grows** — you cannot add reach-through without the total rising. It does not pin individual
  sites, so migrating one read while adding another of the same name (net zero) is permitted; that
  is deliberate (net non-increasing coupling), and it keeps the allowlist line-number-churn-free.

# internal machinery a public API can't express, or internal values with no public accessor — pinned
# WITH the rationale below (like ``test_private_test_imports`` keeps its helper tests), so the count
